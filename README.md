# Ecotrack_Webapp

Welcome to the official repository! This repo contains frontend and backend code in a simple structure and follows our branching and development workflow.

> **Note:**  
> Git does not track empty folders.  
> We included `.gitkeep` files as placeholders to keep empty directories in the repository.

## Branching Strategy

We will use a simple Git Flow to manage our codebase:

| Branch        | Purpose                             |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| `main`        | For Production-ready code only      |
| `dev`         | Our actual development branch         |
| `feature/*`   | New features (branched from `dev`) |
| `personal/*`  | You can have your personal branch(branched from `dev`)  |
